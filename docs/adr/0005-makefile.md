# 1. Makefile

Date: 2020-27-04

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Create a Makefile for the repo.

## Decision

[Makefiles](https://opensource.com/article/18/8/what-how-makefile) allow users to bootstrap key project commands into a single make command.\
This is really useful for showing what features are supported by the solution (e.g. building, testing, docker, etc.) and how the code should/cloud be run.

## Consequences

Make is required to be installed on user machine.
