# Go gRPC

A simple gRPC client and server written in go.\
Both the client and server use the same code generated by the protobuf definition (proto3).

This project is meant to be a template to allow one to quickly bootstrap a gRPC based project.

Note: This project is a WIP and will continue to grow as expertise in gRPC based microservice architecture develops.

## Build

- Generate Protobuf source files:

  ```sh
  protoc --go_out=plugins=grpc:. ./internal/protos/hello.proto
  ```

- Build solution:

  ```sh
  go build main.go
  ```

- Run Server:

  ```sh
  ./main -type server
  ```

- Run client - with message _"my-message"_:

  ```sh
  ./main -type client my-message
  ```

## Docker

Run server and client via docker-compose:

  ```sh
  docker-compose up --build
  ```

Note: The client continously exits when gRPC server successfully recieves message from client
